This week, I feel I made good progress towards the following "I Can" statement: "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." In the past
few weeks, my team has come across some issues with the plugin we choose for the ordering system for our group project. We have had trouble with prices saving 
for any additions or customizations to pizzas. However, after some tinkering and researching, I was able to find a method to set the prices that we would like for
additions and customizations and it show up on the customer's end. My final method was implementing all addons at once with the final pricing that I wanted and 
updating each food item just once. If it gets updated after the addons are already added on, then the prices disappear. So, at this point in time, I have been able
to find a creative workaround in our plugin. In addition to plugins, I have also been heavily reliant on Teams lately to facilitate content and project management. I
utilize Teams to house all important documents for our group projects. Furthermore, I have been utilizing the channels feature to post reminders about small things or content
that still need to be worked out on the site and would be easy to forget without proper reminder. Finally, we have been utilizing Teams to post modular items that
still need to be completed for each section of the Daybreak site.

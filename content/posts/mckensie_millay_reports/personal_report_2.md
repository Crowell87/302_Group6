Much like last week since we are mainly getting acquainted with the foundational aspects of content management,
I feel like I once again made progress this week when it comes to the first class objective, "I can identify
and define key concepts in (web) content management." Not only am I comfortable with defining what content is,
per last week, I now feel confident in my ability to define the purpose of content as it relates to commerce. 
Content has to be sustainable, meaning it has to be worthwhile for consumer attention, and it has to
support the purpose/mission of the organization. Not all content has to make the organization money, but content
*has* to support the organization mission. I learned more about this when reading about the origins of webcomics
this week. When creating webcomics, and especically in the case when webcomes were the creator's sole source of
income, creators had to make sure their content was sustainable so content consumers would like their content
and keep coming back as well as serve whatever mission they aimed for, whether it was technology-based, 
humor, political controversy, deviance, etc. I thought it was also really interesting to listen to the
interview assigned this week about the college of CI and their content creation. I learned that intentionality 
is really important when it comes to content creation as well. Typically, content creation isn't a blanket 
statement. Content is created with a specific audience in mind and content will vary depending on who is 
consuming the conent. For example, the college of CI might create content highlighting the recent 
achievements of the college for alumni, but create content highlighting events taking place in the college for 
students.

This week, I feel I made some progress towards a new "I Can" statement again,
this one being "I can describe and compare content management systems." Not only 
do I feel I can describe a content managememnt system due to our lecture content
for this week, which would be "a software system which automates the tasks around
the management of content... creating, organizing, controlling, securing, and ultimately 
delivering content," I also feel like I have a good understanding of what situations
call for certain CMSs, what skillsets one should try to attain to work effectively
with CMSs, and what role CMSs play in the business world of today thanks to our
interview this week with Jonathan Moore. I feel like having a good handle on these various items
is also extremely important when it comes to having a comprehensive and thorough 
understanding of CMSs. While preliminary, I do think I have a good start to comparing
and understanding different CMSs out there. Just in this week, I got some different
insight into Hugo this week by working with different features when trying to set 
up a rough draft of our "Happy Slices" pizza website as well as some limited
exposure to WordPress when getting started with the Daybreak Contracting project. 
Even in that short amount of time, I could easily see the difference between the
two systems, despite Hugo being a quasi-CMS. I see the benefit in trying 
to learn both considering WordPress is so widely used and Hugo can teach one how 
to work hands-on with code in a CMS, which can be extremely important in working 
with other CMSs, such as WordPress, if a situation calls for that.

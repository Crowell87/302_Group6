This week, I feel I made good progress in yet another "I Can" statement, that statement being "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning."
Considering we got elbows deep in WordPress this week, a lot of us in class were exposed to this new platform in class for the very first time this week, myself
included. Given the wide capabilities of this platform, there is simply not enough time in class for us to learn everything. I decided to do some of my own 
research into the platform in preparation for Wednesday's class this week since we would be getting our first exposure to WordPress then. Some resources that
I looked into this week to learn more about WordPress were WordPress.tv and wpbeginner. I also started looking into some and learning about WordPress plugins this week 
considering the simplest course of action for my group project would be to find a plugin for an ordering system as opposed to building one for scratch. One free food
ordering system plugin that I found and believe could work for our purposes is called RestroPress. It allows multiple menu items, customization, and the option to place
pickup or delivery orders. I am excited to learn more about plugins as the semester goes on!

This week in class we discussed various roles used in managing content. This stemmed from the readings and video interview that we watched over the previous weekend. From this 
week's lecture, I was able to gain a basic understanding of the workflow required to create and manage content. There are a lot of different tasks that need to be done, and 
a wide range of skills required to collaborate. My group was then able to utilize this information to assign roles to ourselves so that we could create an effective workflow 
for the development of our pizza site. On Friday, we had a class wide discussion to establish an efficient and confortable workflow for our community partners. Overall, I had 
a decent week!

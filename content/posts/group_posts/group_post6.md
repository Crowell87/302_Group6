Our group was really happy with the progress we made this week! With the server and WordPress site set up, we were able to actually start making changes to our 
WordPress site and it was really cool seeing things already start to come together. We picked a theme, started setting up the navigation bar, got all of our pages created, 
and successfully implemented RestroPress, which was a free online ordering system plugin. We even got to add in a few menu items and see how that would look in 
RestroPress. We feel really good about where we are at and are excited to see our progress continue this upcoming week. This week, we will focus on getting our menu 
put together and adding more menu items into our site. We will probably have some group members focus on putting the food items on the "Menu" page and others will focus on putting 
those same items in the ordering system. We will want to do this together so that everything stays consistent throughout the site. While we are not going to actually
create them, we thought that a local pizza restaurant could certainly benefit from having a Facebook and Instagram account, not so much Twitter, for additional
content distribution channels. Therefore, we may end up including those logos on our site somewhere, but not actually link them to anything. As far as what is going
less well, we are hoping to get a more consistent commitment to the project from all group members moving forward.

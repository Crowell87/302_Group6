I feel that with the "I can" statement for this week of "I can manage content using established workflows" I understand very well. As in this weeks lecture understanding the term of "workflow" itself is easier to understand it as a whole. As i already have a good foundation of having a good established workflow, as well as content management from just everyday life, working, and college.

This week I feel as though I made more progress towards the "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management" statement. This is because we discussed user 
generated content in our lecture. We defined user generated content as: Content generated by non-editors, usually from the public side of the website. Some examples of user 
generated content include comments, reviews, ratings, etc. My groups and I also made good progress on our websites. I was able to do some formattting to the Daybreak main page 
to make it better mimic the original. The Happy Slices group also did some future planning to make progress towards our end goals.

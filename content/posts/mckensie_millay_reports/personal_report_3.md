I actually feel I made good progress towards a different "I Can" statement this week, that statement being "I can manage content using established workflows." 
While I feel I am in the beginning stages of gaining mastery of this "I Can" statement, it was nice to get some foundational knowledge of workflows this week, 
nontheless, and to see it slightly put into action. I feel I have a much better understanding of the exact definition of "workflow" after this week's lecture,
that being a distinctly defined series of steps (tasks) that content moves through and that content cannot be in more than one step at a time. It aied my
understanding of workflows to come up with different examples of workflows in action and see content actually move through defined workflows, such as Star Wars 
and in Madeline Greenhalgh's place of work. My team has also set up the Planner app in our Microsoft Teams channel and put some preliminary, tentative tasks in
the workflow for our group. We have the beginning stages of our content management mapped out with brainstorming of ideas and further refinement of those content 
ideas assigned to the correct individuals on the team. We plan to continue using this feature to build out our workflows for the project and adding steps that 
all content will move through. 

This is just a side note that also relates to this "I Can" statement but I wasn't sure if it was valid to add to the report. I actually suggested adding this 
same Planner app to one of my other Microsoft Teams this week. Another student and I help design the AN 324 course (Business Data Management) with 
Dr. Heshmati in Gatton and we have a Teams channel to collaborate on different class items. I ran this app by them and they loved it! We used this app to 
have different workflows for homeworks and quizzes as we were completing those items this week and it has been a huge help to have real-time updates on 
where everyone is at in the process. It also has been real cool to see this idea from class being used in a real-world setting!

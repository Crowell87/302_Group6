This week I feel as though I made more progress towards the "I can manage content using established workflows" statement. This is because I made progress on planning out 
the Happy Slices home page. I had a busy week with other classes piling up papers and projects so I wasn't able to work much on the Daybreak site. Looking forward to working on 
the sites more next week!

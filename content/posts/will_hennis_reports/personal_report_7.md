This week was a tough one in general due to majority of my classes assigning large projects and papers all at the same time. I struggled to make it to class, and tried my best 
to communicate with my team. However, by having an established workflow my group was able to understand what progress needed to be made this week. Hopefully I can do a better 
job of managing my work and staying in touch with my team in the upcoming weeks.

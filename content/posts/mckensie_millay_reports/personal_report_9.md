This week, I feel I made good progress towards the following "I Can" statement: "I can manage content using established workflows." This is because we made good 
progress in laying out what still needs to be done as a group for both my group project and my community group's work. In my group project this week, we decided that 
we still need to finish out the ordering system, put together the menu page, add some formatting to the abous us and contact pages, and finish out the home page. Will, 
Sean, and I assigned each other tasks to work on as we continue forward. Will is taking point on the home page, I am working on the ordering system, and Sean is working
on the formatting of the about us and contact us pages. Consistent with our group roles too, Will will approve Sean's formatting work as the site planner. Sean and I 
will check Will's work on the home page to ensure that the content stays consistent with the site. Will will check my work to ensure that the look of the order page
is consistent with site design and Sean will review the content of the order page as well. Austin was not in class this week, but we will most likely assign him some
technical items we are having issues with, such as why we can't see the text of the add buttons on the ordering system, since he is a developer. As for my community team's work, 
we collectively decided what still needs to be accomplished to get the "Fencing" page completed. Most of these items related to formatting issues. We put these items 
on Microsoft Teams and will either collectively work on them or split items up in tomorrow's class. Either way, we now know what steps we need to take to complete 
our portion of the Daybreak site.

I believe after starting this course I have a better understanding of the "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management" statement. As before I started this class I had a good concept of what it meant when talking about content management online. But after the last week it is easier to comprehend when talking about the editorial process, as well as front end strategies and back end strategies. There are different types of langauge as well and not all are meant for human consumption. The biggest outliar of language not meant for human consumption would be computer language such as coding. But some examples I would like to use for understadning the editorial process would be a T.V show called Game Of Throwns. As it goes through the editorial process for human consumption and is made clear and understanding.

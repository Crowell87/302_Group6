This week was a really productive week in my opinion. As far as what is going well, I think most of us are all on the samge page in terms of the direction of
the direction of the project. We also have a very good understanding of who is doing what in the coming weeks to get this project completed as well as what
still needs to be completed to wrap our group project. One thing is not going as well, however, is our plugin issues. We are having some technical issues with our
plugin, such as when we change the prices of add ons for each pizza, they do not update. We believe we have found a creative solution, however, in that we are
just going to provide extra toppings free of charge. What we accomplished this week includes getting our menu page started and about 35-40% of the way done, some
formatting added to the about us and contact page, and some elements added to the home page as well as determining what content we would like on our home page. 
Looking forward to this week, we plan to get our menu page wrapped up with McKensie working on text content and Sean working on the images and Will progressing the
home page as decided last week. Once the menu is completed, we will revert back to the ordering system and work to complete that. Overall, we feel really good 
with where we are at and are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel!

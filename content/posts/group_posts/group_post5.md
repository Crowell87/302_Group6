This week, our group got started with the beginning stages of our WordPress site. We each attempted to download a server on our computers and download WordPress
to activate a WordPress site that we could begin working with. We also found a plugin for an ordering system that we believe would work for our "Happy Slices" 
website. We feel we are in a pretty good spot considering we have multiple members of the group who have a working server and WordPress system on their machine
after Wednesday's class. We also feel pretty confident moving forward considering a big concern for our group was finding a way to implement an ordering system 
into the site since it is a big part of our grade as our group contract is currently laid out. We are excited to get started with actually building our WordPress
site as we move forward and bringing our vision to life now. We will probably develop a more concrete plan for our content on the site next before finally
getting started with implementing that into the site piece by piece. We feel that so long as each of our members commits to their role laid out in their personal
contracts for the project as we head into the more intensive phases of bringing this project together, we will be in a good spot.

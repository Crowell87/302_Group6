This week, I feel I made good progress towards the following "I Can" statement: "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning." A team member and I 
for our community Daybreak project were tasked with looking into Font Awesome icons for each page of the Daybreak site. We had to do some research into how we could
download the images and change the color of each icon. Friday, however, we looked into new ways that we could import the images into the site. After doing some
additional research, I found some custom HTML that allows one to insert and alter each Font Awesome icon with the the Font Awesome plugin installed. I had not 
even heard of Font Awesome before so it certainly took some self-directed learning to learn about Font Awesome, how to work the site, and how to get those images 
imported into our site. As for our group project this week, I also used some self-directed learning. For example, I linked titles of each food category to a page 
containing more detailed information on each category in our menu. However, when you link a text, it automatically underlines the text and I didn't like how that
looked. After some research, I found some CSS that takes away the underline from the title but the link remained.

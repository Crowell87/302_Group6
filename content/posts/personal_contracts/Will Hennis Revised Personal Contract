Revised Personal Contract:

A.	Able to fully complete my responsibilities as a site planner and administrator. This includes designing a sleek layout and architecture for Happy Slices with menus, pictures, 
and an interactive ordering system. Also doing an outstanding job as a communicator and group member.

B.	Able to fully complete the previously listed responsibilities, just not designed as well as the group would like. This would be a decent layout with pictures, menus, and an 
ordering system. Also doing a good job as a communicator and group member. 

C.	Able to partially complete the previously listed responsibilities. The site is missing some design aspects such as pictures, or uniformity between pages, etc. Also doing a 
mediocre job as a communicator and group member.

D.	Only completing a couple of the previously listed responsibilities. This would be having a general design but lacking in features besides text and links. Also doing a poor 
job as a communicatory and group member.

E.	Having a site that is very rudimentary in design. Also being nonexistent as a communicator and group member.

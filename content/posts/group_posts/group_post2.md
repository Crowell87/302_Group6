This week, our group feels that we made good strides in setting some foundation for our project this
semester. We finalized the idea that we want to create a WordPress website for a local pizza 
restaurant that will contain content related to business information, updates, specials, contact
information, a menu, and an order system. We also created and finalized our group contract, which 
outlines what we believe should equal an A, B, and so on for our project. If all goes according to 
plan, our website will be fully functional with information regarding the business, have a consistent 
theme throughout the site, and house an interactive system with our menu and a feature to place to
orders. We feel that we are all on the same page regarding what direction we are headed for the 
project, so we feel that is going well. One thing we feel we could improve on going forward is getting
a more consistent schedule down when it comes to working on the project. Our next step will probably 
include getting a more concrete idea of the exact content we want to include on the different sections
of our site as well as making some strides in setting up the barebones of our WordPress site.

This week I focused on managing content using established workflows by utilizing the schedule and assigned tasks given on our microsoft teams group page. I also utilized technologies related to content management such as going into the wordpress website and adding and editing content on several pages of our website. I helped add text to our widgets and built in reviews for our customers.

This week I feel as though I made more progress towards the "I can manage content using established workflows" statement. This is because my Happy Slices group reconvened to 
make a more detailed list of tasks that need to be done to finalize our website. After creating this list, we then broke the work up into manageable sizes for each member to work
towards. This small organizational meeting allowed us to manage the content and tasks a lot better so that we can progress towards our final goal. This week I also worked with 
my Daybreak group to finish up some of our defined tasks and come closer to mimicking the current Daybreak site.

This week in class we took a deeper look into Wordpress and its capabilities. This gave me a good overview of Wordpress as a whole, and how we may use it to make our Happy Slices 
site and community partner sites. On Wednesday, our group downloaded server software and wordpress to begin working on Happy Slices. We also found a plugin that would simplify 
the ordering aspect of our website. This helped me to identify and employ technologies related to content management.

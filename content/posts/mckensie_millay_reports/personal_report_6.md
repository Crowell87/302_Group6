This week, I feel I made good progress towards the first "I Can" statement again, that one being "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management."
Two big concepts in content management, especically web content management, are presentation and channel distribution. Even though presentation is the topic for 
next week, I have completed the materials for next week and I feel we touched on presentation enough this week for me to say I made good progress in my understanding
of the concept as it relates to content management. Content distribution across multiple channels means expanding the reach of your content and maximizing the audience of your content your content 
by sharing content on multiple content channels, such as website, print, social media accounts, YouTube, etc Thanks to the interview with Meagan this week, I now have a better 
understanding of the importance of expanding your reach across multiple channels of distribution despite the extra workload that comes with that. I also have a more practical
understanding of what specifics need to go into consideration when posting to various social media channels thanks to the interview with Meagan, such as the
character limit with Twitter, the need to be on site for TikToks, and audience considerations for each of the platforms. When it comes to presentation of content as it 
relates to content management, it should be considered as a separate function that works alongisde actual content creation. While it is pretty much impossible to 
separate the two as Deane Barker mentions, they are typically considered separate activities with separate tasks and teams that work on them that are then brought together 
for the final product. That way, content can be created without being adjusted to fit presentation and presentation can be implemented in an effective and consistent way, 
regardless of the content. For example, in the interview for next week with May May, she mentions having different individuals working on content production and content presentation and layout,
such as journalists and designers, respectively. Formatting for headings, copy, layout, etc. is kept in folders in their Google Drive, which can be pulled at any 
time for any new content generated at the KY Kernel.

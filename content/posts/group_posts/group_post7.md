This week, our group feels that we made good progress in terms of content creation. Due to the technical issues in class on Wednesday, we were able to focus
solely on our content. We were able to get a few new menu items in place, came up with our daily specials that we will have posted on our main home page
of the site, and our about us page. Like I mentioned in my personal report this week, I feel like our established workflows really aided us this week in 
knowing where we are in the process, updating our progress, and changing plans as needed. I think we all probably feel group communications could be better
at this point, but we are hopeful that we will improve this as we get more knee-deep in the project. Next week, we will continue adding content to our content plan,
including more menu items and finalizing the about us page. We also plan on getting oursite up and running successfully with the new solution that Dr. Greenhalgh 
comes up with as far as running all of the group projects sites on a server in a more efficient manner.

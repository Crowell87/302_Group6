This week, our group feels we made really good progress towards our WordPress site. With our new WordPress site successfully set up, we were able to upload 
some of the content off our old WordPress site as well as new content we had written as of last week. This included some food items, some daily specials, and our about
us page. We also were able to get some design elements implemented, such as the theme and the configurartion of the sidebar widget. We also were able to get 
RestroPress successfully installed once again. Overall, I think our group feels pretty good for where we are at. We will probably need to get busy with inserting 
some more content into other pages next week. We also will talk about installing other plugins, such as Widget Options, to change when the sidebar Widget shows up
on our site. We also want to find a way for visitors to our site to be able to leave comments/reviews. I think a lot of us were able to get on the same page
this week since 3/4 members were here, so if we could get all four to show up on a consistent basis, we think this would be good for both team communications 
and project progress.

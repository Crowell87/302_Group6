We believe that our group has made pretty good progress for where we are at! We have successffuly set up our Git Hub repository, connected it to Netlify, and launched our site with the foundational code from Git Hub. We also set up a GroupMe for group communications for the project during the semester. After discussion on Friday, we also believe that we have come up with a good idea for a small business that we will be creating a WordPress website for this semester, a local pizza restaurant. We hope that we can implement a fully interactive menu system that will act as the main content on the website for customers. We believe that we are all on the same page as far as the idea that we have for the website and the direction we want to go with this project, which is a good sign at this point in the porcess. Next week, we plan on putting pen to paper and having a more concerete idea of expectations for this semester-long project. We will decide what we hope our final project will look like as well as what roles which team members will play.

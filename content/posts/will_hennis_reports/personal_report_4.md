This week's readings and videos were directed towards defining and understanding content management systems (CMS). This is especially important because we now know the differences 
between some systems, and were even able to get hands on work with a couple through our groups. On Wednesday, we worked with out Hugo groups to plan out our pizza website. In class, 
we decided upon how many pages we would have, and what they would consist of. After brainstorming, we were able to play around with Github and our Hugo site to learn some development. 
We were able to successfully add a menu accross the top, and get one of the menu options to function properly. Once, we got some understanding of how things worked it was pretty 
cool! On Friday, the class mainly worked towards organizing our workflow with our community partners. We were split into groups, got acquainted, logged into wordpress, then did 
a little bit of exploring through wordpress. Wordpress seems to be a bit more user friendly when compared to working with our Hugo site through Github. Overall, it was nice to 
finally get some experience with the CMS's we have been discussing!

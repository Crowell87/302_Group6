Like mentioned in my personal report for this week (McKensie's), I feel like we made really good progress this week because most of everyone was in class, we all 
got on the same page to move forward, and we collectively decided what still needs to be done in terms of our project. We all have a really good idea of what needs
to be done to finish out our project; we just need to complete our respective parts now. As mentioned in my personal report, the high level items we have left to complete are the home page, formatting for the abous us and contact pages, the menu page, finishing up the ordering system, and figuring out how to be selective in 
where the widget appears. We made some decent progress on some of these items in class this week as well. By deciding what still needs to be done, which is what we accomplished this week, we have also determined our next steps. Up to this point, we have also accomplished the content for the abous us and contact pages, the content for our menu, which is also the content for our ordering system, and some broad level aesthetics, which can be seen on the header, widget, and home page. I think communications and group commitment took a big step forward this week. If I had to say one thing that is going less well, I would say maybe our progress for where we are at. We have a really good idea about needs to be done, but we still have a quite bit of work that needs to be done on main site pages. We may want to pick up our pace as we round out the semester.

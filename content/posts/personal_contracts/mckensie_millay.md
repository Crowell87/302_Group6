B:  

Occasional absences for in-class group sessions every now and then 

Mostly an active participant in in-class work, but may not be prepared for those sessions on occasion  

Keeps updated on GroupMe/Teams communication and participates, but it can, at times, be difficult to reach me, especially before a deadline 

Create and edit content, but with a few noticeable issues, such as turning in content past deadlines, obvious that work was put together last minute, etc.  

Content is of decent quality  

Overall, the functionality of the CMS is great, but it has a few spots where it the functionality suffers  

Overall, the CSS/HTML works on the site, but has a few sore spots  

Most tasks are completed on time  

C:  

Frequent absences for in-class group sessions 

There is about an even split of sessions where there is active participation and sessions where there is very little to no participation at all  

Keeps updated on group communications in GroupMe/Teams but there is very little participation/contribution to those communications  

Does the absolute bare minimum that is acceptable as far as content creation and typically does not edit the content that has been created 

Content is of adequate quality, but focuses on hitting the bare minimum requirements for what would be “acceptable”  

The functionality of the CMS obviously has some issues associated with it and impacts performance of it  

The CSS/HTML portions work, for the most part, but there is a pretty good number of technical issues that are associated with the CSS/HTML  

Most tasks are completed on time, but the incompletion of tasks becomes a more regular thing or the work that is being missed/overlooked is quite crucial to the site 

D:  

Absent more than present for in-class group sessions 

When present for in-class work, there is very little to no contribution to group activities/conversation  

Extremely hard to get a hold of me for group communications 

Never contributes anything to team communications – GroupMe or Teams 

Content is edited and created but is often off the mark from what the team was expecting for the content  

Content is more often than not of poor quality 

Overall, the functionality of the CMS is not working well  

The work provided with HTML/CSS is of quite poor quality/does not work  

At least half of the assigned work is not being completed  

E:  

Does not show up to in-class group sessions 

Does not participate in in-class work or virtual communications (GroupMe/Teams) 

Not included in GroupMe/Teams communication  

Does not create or edit a single piece of content  

No quality concerns since there is no content at all  

No CMS implementation in place  

No work with HTML/CSS is provided  

Less than 25% of assigned work is completed

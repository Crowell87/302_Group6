# Group statement 

 

### Our group’s intent is to create a fully functional pizza website. We want our customers to be able to learn about our business, view the menu, place an order, and customize their pizza. The site will have a home page with welcome information and daily specials, an about us page with company information, our menu, an order system, contact information, and additional content as time allows.

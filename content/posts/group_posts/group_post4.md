This week our group was able to brainstorm general ideas for the layout of our pizza website. We discussed how many pages our site would consist of and what content would be on 
each of those pages. We came to the conclusion that we would have a home, menu, order, about, and contact page. We believe the order page and functionality will be the most 
difficult of the 5 pages. This is due to the back-end work required to successfully create, place, and recieve an order. The other 4 pages will likely be static with little 
to no user interactivity. After brainstorming, we were able to play around with Github and Hugo to better understand how we can create our site. Despite knowing that we would 
be using Wordpress instead, it was still nice to get an understanding of how the two CMS's may vary. Overall, our group had a great week and things are coming together nicely!

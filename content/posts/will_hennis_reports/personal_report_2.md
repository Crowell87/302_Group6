This week in class we discussed various methods for the monetization of content. This stemmed from the reading that discussed early webcomics and how they were able to thrive on 
the internet. The reading and class discussion helped to identify the concept of monetization and how it is crucial to content production. Some of these methods included ad 
revenue, merch, paid subscriptions, etc. Commercial content production has become a massive part of today's world, as it is largely present online and even offline. Youtubers, 
streamers, bloggers, and other relatively new professions all utilize monetization to turn a hobby into a job. Some time was also spent discussing with our groups this week. 
My group solidified our plan to create a Pizza Company's website with full functionality. We drafted our initial contract and brainstormed ideas for the site. Overall, this week 
went well and aided progression towards our future goals!

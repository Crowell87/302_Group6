This week was another tough one due to a large amount of class work spread over all of my classes. I have at least 4 groups that I am working with right now between my classes as 
well, so communication and planning is becoming difficult. However, I am getting a grip on things and utilizing my resources for self-directed learning. This is helping me to 
manage all the various assignments and tasks I have to complete.

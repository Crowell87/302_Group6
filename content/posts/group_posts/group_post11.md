This week was also a really productive week, so it was good to see the momentum from last week carry forward. We accomplished quite a bit this week as a group. We
got the menu page completely done and operational, including content, images, and appropriate links. This was the bulk of what we accomplished this week and as such, 
took the most of our time. However, we also made great strides in the ordering system and figured out some quirks with the plugin that we are using for the ordering
system. Everything in the ordering system is operational and ready to go as well now except for specialty pizzas, which just needs to be implemented into the ordering
system. Our progress is the main thing that is going well for us right now, but I also think the direction we're headed in is good. We are getting to the point
where we just need to finish some things out now. The main thing that I believe is going less well, which has been pretty consistent throughout the semester, is just
the inconsistent communication as a group. I think we could probably be better in our communications with one another. Our next steps include putting the home page 
together, finishing the specialty pizzas in the ordering system, adding some content to the about us page, and possibly adding a plugin for customer reviews.

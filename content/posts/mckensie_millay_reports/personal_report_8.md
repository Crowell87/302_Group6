This week, I feel I made good progress towards the following "I Can" statement: "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning." I feel like this was a big 
week for this, personally, because after getting our new WordPress site up, thanks to Dr. Burns, we were able to dive knee-deep into WordPress with the content 
we had planned last week. Therefore, I felt like I was getting a good feel for a lot of different areas of WordPress. With exploration comes new ground and learning
though, so even though some of it I was able to figure out on my own, other parts I found myself searching how to perform a specific function that I wanted. For example, I wanted to change the color of only certain words to red, not the whole block. I knew how to do the latter, not the former. So, I googled
this and found the function from the dropdown area after selecting the text I wanted. Another example of this was figuring out how to get a widget to only appear 
on certain pages of the site. To my knowledge, I believe we will have to install a plugin for this, such as Widget Options. We hope to maybe install this plugin
after approval next week, because we do not want our sidebar widget on the home page as it contains a lot of the same information. Overall, I felt it was a really
good week to utilize resources to our specific WordPress needs. I can definitly see how an in-depth explanation of WordPress just isn't very efficient given groups'
vastly different needs on the platform. Self-directed learning is certainly the best route for this.

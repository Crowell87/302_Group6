I was unable to attend class this week as I did not feel well. However, after reading through the lecture slides and communicating with classmates I got a good sense of what this 
week was about. The lecture slides helped to solidify the main points from the readings of the previous week. These readings helped me to develop and identify key concepts in web 
content management. Specifically in defining what content actually is, and the purpose it is intended for. I now know that content is constructed through an editorial process and 
is meant for human consumption. Examples that come to mind when thinking of content are the various Youtubers and streamers I watch for entertainment. I know that they spend a 
good amount of time editing their raw footage to increase their video's production value to achieve maximum viewership. Of course, their viewers are people, so this would be 
considered content. Another topic I learned about this week is the difference between front-end and back-end strategists. Front-end strategists deal with the personal relations 
aspect of managing content, while back-end strategists do the more technical work to construct the content. In terms of Youtubers, some of them are just personalities who create 
the videos and then have an editor do the technical work. This would be considered a front-end and back-end relation. I will be back in class in the upcoming week!

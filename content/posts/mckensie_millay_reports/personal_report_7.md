This week, I feel I made good progress towards the following "I can" statement: I can manage content using established workflows. This week was a difficult one for
myself and my group mates due to my quarantine. I was not able to be in class this week, so I felt like this was a perfect week to see the importance of 
established workflows. Last week, we were able to get started successfully with setting up our WordPress site with a theme, RestroPress plugin, and a menu. Because
of our established workflow, I was able to know what was expected of me this week for my part in the group project despite not being in person. That certainly is
not possible with fragmented or nonexistent workflows. Furthermore, with things changed in class this week due to technical issues with the server, my group was 
able to communicate with me that we were focusing just on the specific content that will be implemented into the site due to the technical issues. My group updated 
this in our workflow as well and I was made aware of the change this way as well. This also makes it super clear to our team what step in the process we are at 
and what changes were made to the workflow that needed to be communicated to everyone this week. For these reasons, I felt like I was able to see firsthand just
how important established and current workflows really are to a successful project.
